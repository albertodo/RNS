			Design implementation

		<h3>Resource class</h3>
		 - <strong>GET</strong> operation on <strong>/rns/places</strong> that simply returns all places in the system.
		 <br>- <strong>GET</strong> operation on <strong>/rns/places/{id}</strong> that returns the place specified in the path parameter {id} or 404 not found in case of that place does not exist.
		 <br>- <strong>GET</strong> operation on <strong>/rns/places/{id}/vehicles</strong> that returns all tracked vehicles in a given place.
		 <br>- <strong>GET</strong> operation on <strong>/rns/vehicles</strong> which returns all tracked vehicles in the system.
		 <br>- <strong>GET</strong> operation on <strong>/rns/vehicles/{id}</strong> that returns a single vehicle with specified plateId in path parameter {id} or 404 not found in case of that place does not exist.
		 <br><br>- <strong>POST</strong> operation on <strong>/rns/vehicles</strong> that create a new Vehicle in the system. This method is expected to receive a Vehicle object inside the body. The request is accepted if the vehicle does not already exist, if the entrace is an IN or INOUT gate and if the destination exists and it is reachable from entrance. 
		 Moreover the type of the vehicle must be CAR or CARAVAN or TRUCK or SHUTTLE. First of all I check that the request body isn't empty and all attributes properly set, then if the vehicle is admitted a Vehicle object is returned with the entryTime set as the current time of the server, currentPosition set at the entrance gate and the suggested path is calculated.
		 Otherwise if the vehicle is not admitted a customized message is returned to client inside a 400 bad request response body.
		 <br><br>- <strong>PUT</strong> operation on <strong>/rns/vehicles/{id}</strong> that can manage the change sate operation or the move operation or the exit operation of the vehicle with the plateId specified in the path parameter {id}.
		 This method can return a 404 not found if the vehicle does not exist in the system.
		 In the body this method is expected to receive a PutRequest object with the typeOfRequest attribute set to MOVE, CHANGE_STATE or EXIT and value attribute properly set. 
		 For CHANGE_STATE I assumed that you can also try to change for example PARKED with PARKED and no error is returned, obviously nothing change in the vehicle in the service. 
		 For MOVE I assumed that a vehicle can move one step at a time (the newPosition must be adjacent to the previous one). For EXIT I check that the vehicle is in the gate from which it want to exit. 
		 If the operation is allowed it return 204 no content (for exit) and 200 ok for change state and for move (with or without a new suggested path). <br>
		 Otherwise if there are some request error it will return a 400 bad request response with a ResponseBody object in the body with a custom message in the message attribute.
		 <br><br>- <strong>DELETE</strong> operation on <strong>/rns/vehicles/{id}</strong> that delete the vehicle with plateId specified in path parameter {id}. If the vehicle does not exist this method will return a 404 not found response.
		 <br><br>All methods will return 500 internal server error response in case of internal error such as for example if the server shut down unexpectedly.<br>In some methods (where it is necessary) concurrency is also managed.
		
		<h3>DB class</h3>
		<p>
		In the DB class I manage all logic of the service, I check if vehicles and places exist and I manage concurrency on vehicles data structures (that are the unique changes at runtime).
		</p>
		<h3>XML/JSON request/response objects</h3>
		<p>
		- <strong>PutRequest</strong> object contains 2 attribute: 'typeOfRequest' that could be CHANGE_STATE, MOVE or EXIT and 'value' attribute that is the new positon (for MOVE), the gate (for EXIT) and the new state (for CHANGE_STATE).
		<br>- <strong>ResponseBody</strong> object contains just a string to report the proper error code to the client.
		<br>- <strong>Vehicle</strong> object contains all the information specified in assignment 1 part a for vehicles with also the suggestedPath attribute if necessary (that is a list of String in my case).
