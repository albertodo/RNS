		In my design the main resource is rns, then I have 2 sub-resources that are places and vehicles. 
		From both of them is it possible to access a single place or vehicle specifying the proper id in the path and perform some operation on them. 
		Moreover from rns/places/{id} is it possible to access all tracked vehicles in that place by following the uri 'rns/places/{id}/vehicles'.
		All the decisions were taken according to the given specifications.
		In my design there is not data replication and it respects the minimization of number of interaction with the server.<br>
		For more informations about allowed methods on resources (and relative request/response body) please follow this <a href = "./../user/index.html">link</a><br>
